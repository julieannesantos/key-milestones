<h2> 	The First Telephone </h2>
<p> In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell won the first U.S. patent for the telephone. With that patent on his side, in the years of 1877-1888 a series of firsts began: the first telephone line was constructed, the first switchboard was created and the first telephone exchange was in operation! By 1900, Bell had nearly 600,000 telephones in his system. The telephone revolutionized our world, within 20 years over 5.5 million people were using telephones. People imagined the phone to lead to greater advances in networked communications, open up new job opportunities,  be a valuable tool for journalists and bring people closer together, decreasing loneliness and building new communities. And the telephone proved all their theories true. The telephone has changed how we communicate with one another, research information, and create things.

<h2> The First Mobile Phone</h2>
<p> In 1973 the very first mobile phone call was made and in 1983 the first phone launch occurred. It was the Motorola DynaTAC 800x and was priced at around $4,000 and had a talk time of 30 minutes before dying. Since the first phones were "car-phones", (phones to be used while driving), it was about the size of a foot-long sandwich. The mobile phone also changed war communication. During World War One and World War Two the mobile phone was used to open up communication between the battlefields. This phone however didn’t last long. It wasn’t until the USSR invented a telephone that could fit in the palm of your hand that it began to pick up. Companies began to provide costly cell services that would work like a walkie-talkie where each call had to be manually connected by an operator. Specifies on the cell service that the first mobile phone had can be found <a href="https://bebusinessed.com/history/history-cell-phones/">here.</a>  As the demand for phones increased so did wait times, some people waited up to 30 minutes just to place a call. But even with all the wait, by 1990, 2 million phones were sold.

<h2> The First Smartphone</h2>
<p> You might think that it took years for the first smartphone to be invented. If you thought that then you were wrong. The first smartphone was created in 1993. The phone consisted of a calendar, address book, clock, notepad, PDA, email service, QWERTY keyboard, touchscreen, and apps. It was called the 1993’s IBM Simon. It was launched at the price of $899 with a service contract ($1,435 in today's dollars).  All of that was displayed on a 4.5 inches by 1.4 inch screen.
 The phone sold surprisingly well, with approximately 50,000 units. After a price reduction and six months the distributor, BellSouth Cellular took The Simon off the market. This phone was created 10 years before the iPhone and set a precedent for the smartphones to come. With being such an advanced design, The Simon was way ahead of its time.

<h2> The First iPhone</h2>
<p> On June 29, 2007, the first generation iPhone was shipped. This model is nothing of what we would expect in our iPhones today but it revolutionized the smartphone world. It was a  4.5 inches by 2.4 inches and had a max capacity of 16GB. One year before iPhones hit the market, there were 22 million smartphones sold worldwide. The iPhone was met with a lot of doubt. Big name CEO’s like Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer said that the iPhone had no chance.” Along with many other doubters. Steve Jobs wanted to trash the old plastic control buttons and "replace them with a giant screen." <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/06/29/the-story-of-the-original-iphone-that-nobody-thought-was-possible">This page</a>  allows you to see a brief history of how the first generation iPhone came to be. This phone was only sold by AT&T with a 2-year contract. With its release it was met with positive feedback and sold 1.9 million phones in 2007  (statistic by Statista.) following the first generation iPhone came the iPod touch in 2007, and the iPad in 2010. "The first iPhone's legacy is secure as one of the most important products in Apple history," as told by AppleInsider. If that doesn’t show how important this invention was to our present life, 216.76 million iPhones were sold in 2017 and today over 5 billion smartphones are sold worldwide.

<h2> The First Apple Watch</h2>
<p> Less than ten years after the first iPhone was invented came the Apple Watch. In September 2017, the first version of the Apple watch was <a href="https://www.knowyourmobile.com/wearable-technology/a-brief-history-of-the-apple-watch/">annnounced.</a> The first release actually held three different lines: Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport, and Apple Watch Edition. The first watch featured Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and required pairing to an iPhone. Every year since its release, Apple had created a new series of the Apple Watch, upgrading it and allowing for more function.  Apple changed the design of the Apple Watch Sport to make it more affordable and changed its name to Apple Watch Series 1.  Along with Series 1 came Series 2, this one however contrasted Series 1 by having a built-in GPS. The following year Series 3 came out, this Watch allowed for the first time cellular options so you didn’t have to pair the device with your iPhone any longer. In 2018, Series 4 came out along with its updates. Two main upgrades were a larger size, and an ECG, which allowed users to check their heart rates. If these upgrades continue to change our worlds each year, we can only image the Apple Watch in a couple of years!  Today the Apple Watch is the #1 best-selling piece of wearable technology in the world.

  <h2> How it all relates</h2>
  <p> If Bell had not created the telephone, there is a chance that the invention of the mobile phone would not be created for a while to come. If the mobile phone was not created, then who knows when the smart phone would be released, along with that the iPhone, and if the iPhone was not developed when it was, we today might not know the Apple Watch to exist. We live in such a great time today where all five of these things are used by many on the regular basis. We live in a time where you could have a telephone, smartphone, mobile phone, iPhone, and Apple Watch all on the same table and no one would question its being. These are all devices that our everyday routines would probally not be the same without. Who knows what the next innovation in this line of technology will be, but if we have been lucky enough to experice these five, we are in store for something great!</p>
