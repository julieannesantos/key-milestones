<h2> 	The First Telephone </h2>
<p> In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell won the first U.S. patent for the telephone. With that patent on his side, in the years of 1877-1888 a series of firsts began: the first telephone line was constructed, the first switchboard was created and the first telephone exchange was in operation! By 1900, Bell had nearly 600,000 telephones in his system. The telephone revolutionized our world, within 20 years over 5.5 million people were using telephones. People imagined the phone to lead to greater advances in networked communications, open up new job opportunities,  be a valuable tool for journalists and bring people closer together, decreasing loneliness and building new communities. And the telephone proved all their theories true. The telephone has changed how we communicate with one another, research information, and create things.

<h2> The First Mobile Phone</h2>
<p> In 1973 the very first mobile phone call was made and in 1983 the first phone launch occurred. It was the Motorola DynaTAC 800x and was priced at around $4,000 and had a talk time of 30 minutes before dying. Since the first phones were "car-phones", (phones to be used while driving), it was about the size of a foot-long sandwich. The mobile phone also changed war communication. During World War One and World War Two the mobile phone was used to open up communication between the battlefields. This phone however didn’t last long. It wasn’t until the USSR invented a telephone that could fit in the palm of your hand that it began to pick up. Companies began to provide costly cell services that would work like a walkie-talkie where each call had to be manually connected by an operator.
